# CWRU Bootcamp Challenge 11 - Note Registry

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)
    
## Description
    
### The goal of this project was to create a notes registry, that can save notes to a JSON database file called db.json and recall them, displaying them on a html page hosted on a localhost server.
### Behind the scenes, this program heavily relies on Express JS for server hosting/pathing using routers, GET, POST and even DELETE requests!
### In addition, we used ideas, such as DOM traversal and the original index.js predominantly showcased in the Front-End portion of this bootcamp, integrating them and adding in a Back-End!
